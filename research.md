# Research Interests

My core research interest is in raising the abstraction level of mobile software development through design and implementation of programming languages. I am also very enthusiastic about the use of mobile phone technology in the developing world.

I am currently interested in the following research areas:

- **Programming language engineering:** addressing limitations of programming languages which force the programmer to think like the computer rather than having the computer think more like the programmer.  
- **Mobile and pervasive computing**  
- **Context-aware, reactive systems and context-driven interactions**  
- **Distributed systems**  
- **Software security**  
- **Cloud computing**

You can find more about my publications [here](/publications/). My PhD research was about programming language abstractions for reactive context-aware applications.

I am a member of the Software and Enterprise Engineering Research Group of Makerere University. Previously, I was a member of the Software Languages Lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

**AirQo project:** The low-cost and participatory air pollution monitoring (AirQo) project aims to respond to the degrading air quality challenge, an emerging health threat in Africa. We designed and developed AirQo devices capable of measuring particulate matter and other major pollutants as well as environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and location. AirQo monitors have been deployed both at static locations and on motorbikes (locally known as boda-boda) in Kampala city. Deploying the AirQo devices on boda-bodas allows data collection from various areas that the bodas move to.

**Socomot project:** Socomot promises to deliver smart decision-making to farmers through real-time soil conditions monitoring. Specifically, this project aims to:
1. Scale up the development and deployment of smart devices for collecting data about soil conditions.
2. Develop a software platform enriched with big data analytics for soil conditions to facilitate smart and evidence-based decision-making for farmers.
3. Create and provide personalized information services about soil conditions that can enable optimized returns on agro-inputs and effective utilization of resources.

**BRIGHT project:** The BRIGHT project aims to contribute towards sustainable socio-economic growth in Uganda through capacity building in Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) research. Ten PhD students within the areas of digital innovation, software engineering, and entrepreneurship will be trained through a research partnership between Makerere University, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, University of Gothenburg, and Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. The objectives of the BRIGHT project are:
- To increase the number of staff with PhD training in ICT in Uganda.
- To increase the number of ICT innovations and entrepreneurs to facilitate socio-economic growth in Uganda.
- To improve the culture of developing ICT solutions that are designed for scalability and sustainability yet tailored to the local context.

This project is supported by Sida.

**iScheme:** During my PhD research I developed iScheme, a prototype implementation of ambient-oriented programming concepts that runs on iPhone devices. After successfully bringing Scheme to the iPhone platform, our next goal was to go beyond scripting iPhone devices in Scheme. I developed a distribution layer for iPhone development with built-in support for peer-to-peer service discovery, asynchronous remote messaging, and preliminary support for failure handling (timeout-based). A more extended description of iScheme is available [here](#). Representative AmbiScrabble game and PolyGlot chat applications developed in iScheme are also available [here](#).

**Flute:** Flute is an experimental programming language that I designed to ease the development of reactive context-aware mobile applications. The language is implemented as a meta-interpreter in iScheme. Thanks to iScheme‚Äôs support for a language symbiosis between Scheme and Objective-C, Flute programs can access context sensor APIs (such as GPS and accelerometer sensors) available on iOS devices. I have created a dedicated page for the Flute language [here](#).
