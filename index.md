I am a **Data Scientist** and MSc researcher focused on trustworthy, privacy-preserving analytics for social impact.  
My work explores how *deep-learning systems* and *statistical modelling* can inform better decisions in health, climate, and finance.

> **I believe computational intelligence, guided by ethics, can transform society for the better.**

Currently I lead projects on **climate-risk dashboards**, **fraud detection with differential privacy**, and **AI-assisted learning tools** for low-connectivity schools.

We are driving five thematic areas:

- **AI for the Environment**  
- **African AI Cloud/Compute Infrastructure**  
- **AI for Finance**
