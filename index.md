I am a **Professor of Computer Science** and the Chair of the Department of Computer Science at **Example University**.  
My research concerns scalable decision-support systems for climate resilience, and I am passionate about widening access to high-quality CS education.

> **I believe in the transformative power of computational technology and intelligence to tackle complex societal challenges and improve people's lives.**

Currently, I lead several research initiatives aimed at creating and applying computational methods and tools that can significantly improve quality of life, particularly in low-resource contexts. Through these efforts I strive to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact.
