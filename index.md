I am a Professor of Computer Science and the Chair of the Department of Computer Science at Makerere University. My research is focused on leveraging Computer Science to develop novel solutions to global challenges. I am also passionate about advancing high-quality Computer Science education ‚Äî that is of sufficient breadth and depth, practical and fast enough, and responsive to the fast-evolving demands of the field.

> **I believe in the transformative power of computational technology and intelligence to tackle complex society challenges and improve people's lives.**

Currently, I lead several research initiatives aimed at creating and applying computational methods and tools that can significantly improve the quality of life, particularly in the context of developing countries. Through these efforts, I strive to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world impact, ensuring that technological advancements contribute meaningfully and responsibly to addressing societal needs.

Previously I investigated and developed programming languages and software tools to help programmers easily write highly adaptive and distributed mobile software without worrying about low-level concerns. My research in this area helped create iScheme and Flute programming languages. In 2008, I pioneered iScheme as an alternative programming language to develop mobile applications for the iPhone after it was launched in 2007.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science (with Greatest Distinction ‚Äî ‚ÄúSumma cum laude‚Äù) and an MSc. (with Great Distinction) in Computer Science from Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium in 2008 and 2012, respectively. I received a B.Sc. (First Class Honors) in Computer Science from Makerere University in 2006, where I also received the Best Science and Overall Best Graduate award for that year. Prior to returning to Makerere University I worked as a pre-doctoral and post-doctoral researcher at the Software Languages Lab, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium. Before that I worked in the software-development industry and IT management in Uganda.

<span class="tag">Flagship initiatives and projects</span>

I have had the privilege of leading teams of talented individuals dedicated to addressing complex societal challenges. I founded or co-founded AirQo, Crane Cloud and Sunbird AI, among others. Our current initiatives span five key areas:

- **AI for the Environment**
- **African AI Cloud/Compute Infrastructure**
- **AI for Finance**
- **AI for Healthcare**
- **Non-profit AI for Social Good**

<span class="tag">Notable projects</span>

**AirQo.Africa:** At AirQo we pioneered AI-driven technology to provide communities and cities across Africa with accurate, hyper-local, real-time air-quality data, empowering them to mitigate air pollution. AirQo now operates in more than 15 African cities and provides information covering over 60 million people, thanks to partnerships with Google and others.  
**Crane Cloud:** We are developing a multi-cloud compute solution that supports seamless AI computation, enabling app and service portability between private and public clouds. The platform is tailored for African challenges such as limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity and power outages.  
**Sunbird AI:** Sunbird AI develops non-profit AI technologies for social good in Africa, targeting key developmental and societal challenges.  
**HASH:** HASH focuses on using AI to improve maternal, sexual and reproductive-health outcomes, emphasising responsible AI in healthcare systems.

<span class="tag">Past research projects</span>

**iScheme and Flute programming languages.** Early in my career I created iScheme and Flute to let programmers build adaptive mobile software without worrying about low-level concerns. In 2008 I used iScheme to develop iPhone apps shortly after the phone‚Äôs 2007 launch.  
**BRIGHT:** Through the BRIGHT project we trained 10 PhD and 5 post-doctoral researchers between Makerere University, Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg, advancing computer-science expertise in Uganda.  
**COAST:** The COAST project delivered AI and data systems for targeted surveillance and management of COVID-19, improving pandemic-response strategies in Uganda and helping prepare for future health crises.
